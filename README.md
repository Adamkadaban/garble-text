# Garble Text

This plugin exposes the `garbleText()` function in Obsidian. Use the commands palette (`ctrl+p`) to find the function **Toggle Garble Text**.

Garbling text in Obsidian turns all content in the entire app (notes, sidebar, etc) into lines so you can take screenshots without exposing sensitive data.

## Update Log

2021-08-13: Changed from two commands `Garble` and `Ungarble`, to one `Toggle Garble`.
