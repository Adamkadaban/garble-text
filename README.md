## Garble Text

This plugin exposes the garbleText() function in Obsidian. Use the commands palette (`ctrl+p`) to find the functions Garble Text and Ungarble Text.

Garbling text in Obsidian turns all content in the entire app (notes, sidebar, etc) into lines so you can take screenshots without exposing sensitive data.
